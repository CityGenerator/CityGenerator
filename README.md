#What is CityGenerator?#

CityGenerator is a suite of tools that can help generate a unique campaign setting in seconds. 

#Where did it come From?#

CityGenerator has been a labor of love for several years. Originally a bash script used to generate population statistics, CityGenerator has grown a set of perl scripts that  encompass NPC creation, Government and Military details, weather patterns, establishments and more.
