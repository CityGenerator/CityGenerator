                                <sub>Note: The purpose of this tool is not to provide you with a complete, logical, feasible city- quite the contrary. The purpose is to give a DM a seed for building their own city. If things don't make sense, try to figure out the conditions that lead to that state. The intersting backstory comes from the DM excercising their imagination.</sub>
